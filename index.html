          <h1>The Demographics of Motherhood</h1>
          <hr class="my-4" />
          <p>
            Using data provided by the U.S. Census, I analyzed the data of all
            women between the ages of 15-50 who have given birth within the past
            year to greater understand the demographics they inhabit across the
            United States.

            <h2>Correlations in Demographics of Pregnant Women</h2>
            <p>
              By using the above graphics, we can examine if there is any
              correlation between given demographics of women between the ages
              of 15-50 who have given birth in the past year. The dataset used
              is based on 2017 ACS 5-year estimates from the <strong>U.S. Census Bureau
              and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System:
              <a
                href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_S1301&prodType=table."
                >Search Results Dataset</a
              ></strong>
              The numbers reported are estimates of the % of distribution for
              each demographic.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
              One observation is that there is a correlation between poverty and
              women without a high school degree within this population. Puerto
              Rico appears to be an outlier here in that there is a high level
              of poverty in this demographic, but an average level of women
              without a high school degree.
            </p>
            <p>
              There also appears to be a correlation between being unmarried and
              being in poverty in this demographic. In this case, Puerto Rico
              has both the highest rate of unemployment and the highest rate of
              unmarried women in the United States, whereas Utah has the
              smallest rate of both.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another observation is that there is a correlation between being a
              teenager and experiencing poverty within this demographic. Again,
              Puerto Rico has a very high percentage of both as compared to the
              rest of the United States.
